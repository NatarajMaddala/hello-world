Just Starting with Github
Hey!. I have just started with github. 
I have a doubt is coding and programming skills sufficient to get a job in product based companies, or we should know the knowledge of computer organization and architecture, computer networks, data communications, fundamentals of data logic circuits. etc. Can anybody help me?
